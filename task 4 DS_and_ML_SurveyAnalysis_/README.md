#  Data Science & Machine Learning Survey Analysis (2017–2021)

##  Overview

This project explores trends and insights from the **Kaggle Data Science Survey (2021)**. The dataset includes over **25,000 responses** from professionals and learners worldwide, offering a rich view of the global data science ecosystem. The goal was to analyze **salary trends**, **gender distribution**, **experience levels**, **tools used**, and **country-wise patterns** using Python in Google Colab.

##  Key Findings

###  **Salary Distribution**
- The most common salary group among respondents was **"<15k USD"**, indicating a large number of beginners or contributors from lower-income regions.
- Salary bands **between $40k–$60k and $60k–$90k** were also significant, possibly representing mid-career professionals.

###  **Top Countries**
- The majority of respondents came from the **United States**, followed by **India, Japan, China, and the UK**.
- A strong representation from South Asian and European countries reflects the global popularity of data science careers.

###  **Gender Representation**
- The field is still **male-dominated**, with **fewer female and non-binary respondents**.
- Gender diversity remains a challenge across most salary brackets and roles.

###  **Experience vs Salary**
- Respondents with **more than 10 years of experience** tended to fall into higher salary brackets.
- However, even **newcomers (1–3 years)** are earning mid-range salaries, especially in countries like the US and UK.

###  **Education Levels**
- Most respondents had a **Bachelor’s or Master’s degree**, typically in Computer Science, Engineering, or related fields.
- A growing number of learners are also entering with **online certifications** and **bootcamps**.

###  **Popular Tools**
- **Python, SQL, and R** were the top three programming languages.
- Other frequently mentioned tools included **TensorFlow**, **Scikit-learn**, and **Jupyter Notebooks**.

##  Conclusion

This analysis highlights key demographic and career trends in data science as of 2021. Salaries are influenced by **experience, geography, and job role**, while tools like **Python and SQL** remain dominant. The field is growing fast, but **diversity and equitable income distribution** remain important areas for improvement.
